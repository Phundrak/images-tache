This software is a University assignment for its two contributors, Lucien Cartier-Tilet (me, owner of the repo) and Adrien Leroy-Lechat. Its aim: detect and list regions of colors in the input file, trace its border in black (the border is one pixel large). It can also accept some color tolerance while detecting colors. The result will then be saved in another output file. The only supported format is the /ppm/ image format. Full instructions [[http://www.ai.univ-paris8.fr/~jj/Cours/LI2/PPI2_17.html][here (in French)]], first assignment /1. Images taches. (***)/.
